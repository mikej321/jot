/* Instructions for form toggle */

 1. Create both forms in the frontend. Make it to where react renders
    one or the other via state. The state will be toggled by clicking
    on the toggleIndicator div. Turn the pointer events off on the
    Log In and Sign Up button and instead, have the pointer events
    on toggleIndicator.

2. Add the necessary regex tests for the inputs in the forms that will be created.
